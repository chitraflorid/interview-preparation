1- DropBox works on the principle of Cloud Computing meaning all the data you uploaded will be stored in the HUGE Server and also on the application from where you have uploaded.( Say from your desktop etc) Once, you downloaded it, the same thing happens, It won't get delete until U manually delete it by yourself.
