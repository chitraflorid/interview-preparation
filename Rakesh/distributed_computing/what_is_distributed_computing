What is distributed computing?

Traditionally computation is performed on single computers
Larger scale projects - Larger Scale Effect the processing power may not enough for single computers. So we need more processing power here.

1- So we distribute the workload across mutiple computers so that we can easily solve our task

2- All the computers are working on unison so we get the results fast.

3- All the tasks are not suitable for distributed computing

4- It is extremely difficult to divide a task if where intermediate steps require the result from previous steps.

5- parallel tasks are best for distributed computing. Since one task doesn't rely on other tasks

6- Host computer will ran the main program ..divide the task..host will generate intermediate result ...combine all the results

7- Distributed computing is also known as horizontal computing
