Sed is a popular utility which enables quick parsing and transformation of text.

Here are some very simple examples of sed in action.

Substitute the first occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool'.

`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/
My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim.

Substitute all the occurrences of 'editor' with 'tool'.

`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/g
My favorite programming tool is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.

Substitute the second occurrence of 'editor' with 'tool'.

`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/tool/2
My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another tool I like is Vim.

Highlight all the occurrences of 'editor' by wrapping them up in brace brackets.

`$:~/hackerrank/bash/grep/grep1$` echo "My favorite programming editor is Emacs. Another editor I like is Vim." | sed -e s/editor/{\&}/g
My favorite programming {editor} is Emacs. Another {editor} I like is Vim.
