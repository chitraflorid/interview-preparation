sed 's/\bthe\b/this/1'

Here I am replacing 'the' with 'this' through sed

\b in regular expressions match word boundaries (i.e. the location between the first word character and non-word character):

$ echo "bar embarassment" | sed "s/\bbar\b/no bar/g"
no bar embarassment

-for matching the exact word we can use word boundary. It is extremely simple to use
